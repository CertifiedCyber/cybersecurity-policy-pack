# 🧾 Cybersecurity Policy Pack – NIST & ISO-Based GRC Framework

This self-initiated cybersecurity governance project simulates the responsibilities of a GRC analyst in a small-to-medium business (SMB) environment. The objective was to design essential security policies, align them with industry frameworks (NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001), and practice risk identification and mitigation strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create essential cybersecurity policies for a fictional organization
- Align documentation with controls from NIST CSF and ISO 27001
- Simulate real-world governance and compliance responsibilities
- Practice risk identification, scoring, and treatment planning

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks Used

| Tool/Framework           | Purpose                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** | Controls mapping, structure      |
| **ISO/IEC 27001**        | Policy alignment and best practices |
| **Excel / Google Sheets**| Risk register creation              |
| **MS Word / Markdown**   | Policy documentation                |
| **MITRE ATT&CK (optional)**| For threat modeling (future)     |

## 🗂️ Deliverables

### 1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
Outlines employee responsibilities, acceptable behaviors, and prohibited actions when using company-owned or connected systems. Includes scope, enforcement, and violations.

### 2. Incident Response Policy
Defines procedures for identifying, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. Includes incident roles, escalation paths, and post-incident reviews.

### 3. Remote Access Policy
Sets rules for secure remote access to company systems, including VPN use, device requirements, multifactor authentication (MFA), and data protection measures.

### 4. Risk Register
Created a structured risk register containing:
- Asset classification
- Threat/vulnerability mapping
- Likelihood and impact scoring
- Risk ranking (High, Medium, Low)
- Recommended mitigation strategies

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add Security Awareness & Data Classification policies
- Expand risk register to include regulatory risk (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Create audit checklists and gap analysis reports
- Map each policy to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (where applicable)

## 📌 Why This Matters

Most entry-level cybersecurity professionals neglect the governance side of security. This project demonstrates practical understanding of how organizations document, communicate, and manage security standards—skills critical in SOC 2, ISO 27001, or internal audit contexts.
